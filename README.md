# text-wars
Fantasy RPG style developer commands

This repo is inspired by my all time favorite game Aardwolf. 

www.aardwolf.com

Aardwolf is a text-based mud. When I played during college my friends always called it TextWarz which inspired this project. I basically wanted to make working in a terminal more like playing the game. 

For right now I have started by creating an Oh My ZSH theme file with a bunch of aliases.
